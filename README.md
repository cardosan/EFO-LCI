# EFO-LCI: European Forestry Operations Life Cycle Inventory

## About

The European Forestry Operations Life Cycle Inventory (EFO-LCI) contains life cycle inventory (LCI) data on the forest management practices of 29 countries within the European subcontinent based on a questionnaire filled by silvicultural experts. We first classified European forest on the basis of what we called "forest unit" (the combination of silvicultural practices and tree species) and, for each Forest Unit (FU) we constructed a LCI.

### Methodology

These data were gathered from national forestry expertise based on published and unpublished scientific studies, national reports, national laws, personal knowledges etc. The dataset, questionnaire, methodology and mein results of this work are described in the pubblication ..................

### Scope

While the work was done mainly for life cycle analysis purposes, its scope it is not limited to this and can be used also for other purposes and from people from other sectors. It is our hope that making these data available will improve the study on life cycle impact of forest management and forest management in general.

### Geographical coverage of the data

At time of publication, the EFO-LCI contained 235 FUs described in 29 different European countries. The work for now cover only the European continents, being this the scope of the project, but could be further extended to other geographical areas.

## HOW TO CITE

## Using EFO-LCI

Both the data in EFO-LCI and the underling MS access questionnaire used to build it are released under the [Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license, and can therefore be shared, reused and modified for non commercial use simply giving credits to the authors. To recognise and give credits for this work , we thus simply kindly ask you cite the above article.

### Database organization

The database simply consists of two excel files, one named [general_information](database/general_information.xls) and containg the info about the single forest unit in the country, and one named [interventions](database/interventions.xls) with the detailed description of the interventions.


### Download questionnaire and database

The database has been contructed as a simple excel file containing as UUID the combination of Country name, silvicultural system and species group (see article about this classification), while the questionnaire is an excel file with 5 front-end forms linked to as many relational databases.

The database can be downloaded from [here](database) while the questionnaire can be downloaded from [here](questionnaire)
