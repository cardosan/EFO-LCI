Germany,Even-aged forest with shelterwood,Slow growing shade tolerant deciduous,"Beech stands are single tree species stands of one age, or mixed with valuable (slow growing) deciduous tree species, Picea abies, Abies alba or Douglas fir (less often Abies grandis).

Where e.g. Picea abies is not part of the PNV (potentially natural vegetaion) those stands are transformed to beech by planting beech under shelter.

Stem of height/diameter relation < 80!, crown >40% of height. Less often valuable timber of high quality (pruning up to 6m) is the aim of the management (low risk stands, no red deer et al.
